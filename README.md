# F28WP-Dubai-Flat
Coursework for Semester 1, F28WP course
This is a web-game where:
- Players are put into a map where they can only traverse through laser paths created by laser generators.
- The goal of the player is to survive for the longest period of time 
- They can do this by eliminating other players present on the map by attacking them, or changing laser generator directions
