# F28WP-Dubai-Flat
Coursework for Semester 1, F28WP course
This is a web-game where:
- Players are separated into 2 teams, the Survivors and the Chasers
- The players must move and navigate through a maze where the path is made of lasers and must finish the goal corresponding to their team
- The Chasers must catch the survivors moving through the maze to win
- The Survivors must evade the Chasers and catch flags/points in the maze to win 

Players can play this game by joining lobbies containing dozens of players. 75% of the players in a lobby will be assigned to the Chasers team
