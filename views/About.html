            <p id = "text1">Dystopian Rush is an arcade survival game requiring you to dodge incoming obstacles in a post-apocalyptic world. 
                The obstacles in this game are rocks. Rocks are falling from the sky and you have to stay alive for as long as possible.
                 The rocks will come in more often and faster as time goes by. If the rocks comes into contact with you, it's GAME OVER! 
                 You can use the arrow keys or the A/D keys to move sideways and evade the plummetting rocks. 
                 The longer you survive, the more points you will score and the top 6 highest scores will be displayed on a leaderboard.
                 So Try your best to get your name on that leaderboard! <br><br>
            
                 Show us your skills of dodging all the rocks for as long as long as possible. (P.S I hope you enjoy the music) <br><br><br>
